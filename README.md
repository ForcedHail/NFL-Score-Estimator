# NFL-Score-Estimator

This project uses web-scraping methods from profootballreference to gather data for teams and players, and was all written in Python. 

Entering 1 initially takes 2 user's inputs of abbreviations for NFL teams and a year and estimates a score and each team's passing and rushing yards for a theoretical game between the teams based on their past performances in the given season.
These are the abbreviations for all 32 NFL teams. Type exactly the 3 letter abbreviation, case sensitively:
- crd (Cardinals)
- atl (Falcons)
- rav (Ravens)
- buf (Bills)
- car (Panthers)
- chi (Bears)
- cin (Bengals)
- cle (Browns)
- dal (Cowboys)
- den (Broncos)
- det (Lions)
- gnb (Packers)
- htx (Texans)
- clt (Colts)
- jax (Jaguars)
- kan (Chiefs)
- rai (Raiders)
- sdg (Chargers)
- ram (Rams)
- mia (Dolphins)
- min (Vikings)
- nwe (Patriots)
- nor (Saints)
- nyg (Giants)
- nyj (Jets)
- phi (Eagles)
- pit (Steelers)
- sfo (49ers)
- sea (Seahawks)
- tam (Buccaneers)
- oti (Titans)
- was (Commanders)

Entering 2 initially takes the user's inputs of player position (QB, RB, WR, TE only) and his name and predicts their fantasy points for the upcoming week.

Entering 3 initally will give a 50% chance to show a hypothetical game between a random 2 of the 32 nfl teams in a given random year since the 32nd team (Texans) was introduced. The other 50% chance will show the estimated fantasy points of a random player of a random position.
